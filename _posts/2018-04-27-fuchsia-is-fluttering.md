So couple of weeks back, on a usual hot and humid day in Mumbai my flatmates were discussing the tech landscape and how he was developing an android app to demonstrate a new range of products to client but he was worried that he had an android phone but the people who he was presenting had iphones. He was looking for solution which could save him time developing separately on both platforms. Having already gone through several cross platform frameworks, he wasn't much amused with the idea of using javascript which forms the core for majority of the cross platform mobile development frameworks.<br>
Enter me, I have been reading about this awesome new framework google has been building which is destined to be a part of something even "bigger". The operating system which will target the next billion of connect devices which. So, we thought that spending the evening trying it out would be an awesome idea and we felt that it was worth every bit of the effort.
